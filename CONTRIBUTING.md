### Code

Implementing new codecs, container formats or protocols is always welcome!

### Tests

It is strongly suggested to provide test along changes so the coverage stays around the **85%**, helping to
get to full coverage is pretty welcome.

### Benchmark

Help in making sure the code does not have performance regression, by improving the benchmark suite or just by
running it weekly, is welcome as well.

### Documentation

To preview changes to the documentation: use `cargo doc` with [`cargo
external-doc`](https://github.com/Geal/cargo-external-doc)

## Style

### Issue style

Try to write at least 3 short paragraphs describing what were you trying to achieve, what is not working and
the step by step actions that lead to the unwanted outcome.

If possible provide:

- a code snippet or a link to a [gist][is1] showcasing the problem, if is a library usage issue.
- a backtrace, if it is a crash.
- a sample file, if it is a decoding or encoding issue.

### Coding style

The normal rust coding style is checked by [rustfmt][cs1].
Readable code is the first step on having good and safe libraries.

To avoid slight differences appearing in nightly versions, please
use the following command to run rustfmt: `cargo +stable fmt`
