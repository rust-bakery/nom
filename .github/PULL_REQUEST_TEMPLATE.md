Hello, and thank you for submitting a pull request to nom!

First, please note that, for family reasons, I have limited time to work on
nom, so following the advice here will make sure I will quickly understand
your work and be able to merge it early.
Second, if I don't get to work on your PR quickly, that does not mean I won't
include it later. Major version releases happen once a year, and a lot of
interesting work is merged for the occasion. So I will get back to you :)
